- **CAP1166**: Microchip Technology CAP1166 Capacitive Touch Controller
- **DS18B20**: Maxim Integrated DS18B20 1-Wire (128x128 pixel display) Digital Thermometer
- **IS31FL3731**: Integrated Silicon Solution Inc (ISSI) IS31FL3731 Matrix LED Driver
- **LSM303D**: STMicroelectronics LSM303D eCompass 3D Accelerometer and 3D Magnetometer
- **MCP9808**: Microchip Technology MCP9808 Digital Temperature Sensor
- **SH1107**: Display Future / Sino Wealth SH1107 128x128 Dot Matrix OLED Driver/Controller (128x128 pixel displays)
- **TCS3472**: ams TCS3472 Color Light Sensor
- **VEML6075**: Vishay Semiconductors VEML6075 UVA and UVB Light Sensor

It also supports additional display modes through its **SYSTEM** and **CLOCK** modules, as well as the HTML5/CSS3 browser **DASHBOARD** module (see image above) that provides an overview of the current status and readings of all sensors and devices available on the system.
