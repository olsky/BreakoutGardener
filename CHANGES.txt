// ============================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------ Version 19.12.13 (R2C) ----------

- Added support for the AMS AS7262 6-channel Spectral Sensor (-> violet/blue/green/yellow/orange/red spectrometer)
  * Use of the illuminations LEDs can be enabled using the setting as7262LEDEnable at the top of Breakout_Gardener.js
- Added support for the Holtek HT16K33 based Pimoroni Four Letter pHAT (-> four 14-segment displays with green LEDs)

- Added SGP30 device availability detection for the "proxied" interface towards Apple HomeKit (see R2A below)

- Now optionally soft resetting all [supporting/applicable] devices also on startup (previously only on exit)
  (nb. this takes a few extra seconds on startup, but may improve device re-reachability after certain errors etc;
  disable the setting resetI2CDevicesOnStartup at the top of Breakout_Gardener.js if your device doesn't like this!)
- Added a link to the latest CHANGES.txt on GitHub to the footer of the DASHBOARD
- Minor fixes and polishing

------------------------------------------------------------- Version 19.10.4 (R2B) ----------

- Added support for the Sensirion SHT31D Humidity & Temperature Sensor
- Added support for the Texas Instruments DRV2605 based Pimoroni Linear Actuator Haptic Breakout
  * ...including some buzzing (pun intended) new effects for a few other applicable modules! =]
    (e.g. CLOCK when the hour changes, SGP30 when air quality deteriorates to IAQ level 3 ("Moderate")
     or above, VEML6075 when UV radiation increases to index level 3 ("High") or above...)
- Added support for the KEBA KeContact P30 series wallbox charging station (via UDP based API)
  * Yup, now you can watch your electric car getting fed in the same place as all your other sensors! ;)
  * ...and if the Haptic Breakout (see above) is installed, it will buzz when charging is finished! :D
- Changed most bus wait states from somewhat unpredictable/async setTimeout() variants to maybe less elegant
  but also more predictable performance.now based busy loops (nb. doesn't matter much in our case anyway)

- With ~20 modules now available, the default DASHBOARD display mode is now to use multiple rows
  of 10 modules each (nb. this is configurable from the top of Breakout_Gardener.js though; single row
  still looks quite cool on ultra-wide desktop displays but is much less practical on smaller displays)

------------------------------------------------------------- Version 19.5.30 (R2A) ----------

- Added support for the Sensirion SGP30 Indoor Air Quality (TVOC and CO2eq) Gas Sensor
- Added support for the Vishay Semiconductors VCNL4010 Proximity/Light Sensor
- Added support for the Analog Devices ADXL343 Triple-Axis Accelerometer
- Added support for the IS31FL3731 based Pimoroni 11x7 White LED Matrix Breakout
  * ...including matching new/complementary display modes for all other applicable modules! 8)
- Added preliminary support for the Pimoroni Trackball Breakout (nb. this requires I2C bus speed at max *250* kHz!)
  * Left/Up -> Previous display mode. * Right/Down -> Next display mode.
  * Short Press Click -> Turn displays and Auto-Rotate on. * Long press click -> Turn displays off.
  * Known issues/caveats: In my experience, the clock-stretching Trackball does not play well with the SGP30,
    but more testing needed (I will then update this .txt accordingly) and your mileage may vary... ;)
- Improved support for the Analog Devices ADT7410 Digital Temperature Sensor (misc bug fixes)

- Changed the BMP280 module's SH1107 display mode to provide equivalent/more focus to air pressure
  (also because it is in my experience not a particularly good thermometer; hence the BME series?)
- Changed all SH1107 display mode "title bars" to reflect only the name of the module/device (less cluttered)
- Changed the order of the display modes to make the progression feel a bit more natural... :)
  (currently being ~ clock->cpu%->temperature(s)->pressure->air->UV/light->motion->analog->system->friend,
  but this could of course be adjusted again in the future due to e.g. new types of sensors/modules)

- Added the first BG "proxy" module - SGP30 - to interface with Apple HomeKit through HAP-NodeJS! :D

- Added a "Visualize" (-> open Grafana [host:3000] in a new window/tab) button to the DASHBOARD
  (nb. this assumes that you have Prometheus and Grafana installed on the same host as BG itself)
- Added a timestamp to the DASHBOARD (i.e. when last refreshed, fetched from the CLOCK module)

------------------------------------------------------------- Version 19.2.28 (RC1D) ----------

- Fixed a typo in the BMP280 module which caused wrapped temperature readings above ~26.4Â°C
  (and, since the pressure calculations in turn include the temperature as an input value,
  the pressure readings were also affected when this happened)

------------------------------------------------------------- Version 19.2.26 (RC1C) ----------

- Finally some nice weather with sufficient sunlight to test and adjust the VEML6075 module :)
- Minor refinements to the I2C device identification functionality

-------------------------------------------------------------- Version 19.2.8 (RC1B) ----------

- Added preliminary support for the Analog Devices ADT7410 Digital Temperature Sensor
  (based purely on the information in the datasheet; still to be tested with a real device)
- Added server socket keep-alive timeouts to the DASHBOARD and PROMETHEUS modules
- Fixed a couple of missing device availability checks in auto-rotating display mode

-------------------------------------------------------------- Version 19.2.5 (RC1A) ----------

- First official preview release

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
